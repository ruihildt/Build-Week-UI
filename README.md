# Build-Week-UI
Creation of a multi-page marketing website from scratch with HTML / CSS / LESS / JS.

## Pitch
A platform like AirBnB but for high end electronics. Tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? 
Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person! 


## My role in this project
- [ ]  You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen and provides details about the product to build.
- [ ]  Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.
- [ ]  The call to action on the website should be a login button.
- [ ]  Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".
- [ ]  For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product.
- [ ]  Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.
- [ ]  For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members, and links to one another's socials/Github.
